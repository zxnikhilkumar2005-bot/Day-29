# Day 29 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the **JavaScript exercises and experiments** I completed as part of **Day 29** in *Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0*.  
It covers **core JavaScript concepts** including operators, hoisting, conditional statements, and logical reasoning, tested directly in the browser console.

---

### 🧠 About the Day 29 Task
Day 29 focused on practicing and experimenting with **JavaScript operators**, **variable hoisting**, and **conditional statements**.  
The goal was to strengthen understanding of how JavaScript evaluates expressions, handles variable scope, and performs logical and conditional operations.

### ✨ Task Description

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Basic Operators** | Practiced *arithmetic*, *assignment*, *increment/decrement*, *comparison*, *logical*, and *bitwise* operators. |
| **Variable Hoisting** | Explored behavior of **var**, **let**, **const**, and function declarations or expressions. |
| **Conditional Statements** | Used **if**, **else if**, **else**, **ternary**, and **switch** for decision-making logic. |
| **User Interaction** | Implemented **prompt()** to take user input for *age*, *marks*, and other values. |
| **Logical Operators** | Applied **(&&)**, **(||)**, and **(!)** to create complex conditions and validate multiple checks. |
| **Bitwise Operators** | Introduced **(&)** and **(|)** for simple bitwise calculations. |

### 🧰 Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** – Core concepts, operators, hoisting, and conditional logic  
- **Browser Console** – Running scripts and checking outputs  
- **HTML** – For embedding scripts and testing interactions

### 📘 Learning Outcome

Through this task, I learned how to:
- Understand and apply **JavaScript operators and logical expressions**
- Use **hoisting** with `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Build **conditional logic** using if-else, switch, and ternary operators
- Collect **user input** and process it through conditions in real-time
